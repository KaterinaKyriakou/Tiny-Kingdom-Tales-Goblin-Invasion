Ah, greetings, brave knight! You've come at a dark time for Tiny Kingdom.
Our peaceful days were shattered when goblins emerged from the depths of the dark caves, bringing terror and chaos to our land. But not all hope is lost. 
To reclaim our peace, you must speak with the Commander, who is stationed near the castle.
He will guide you on your quest to vanquish the goblins and restore our beloved kingdom. May fortune favor you on your journey. Tiny Kingdom's fate rests in your hands.

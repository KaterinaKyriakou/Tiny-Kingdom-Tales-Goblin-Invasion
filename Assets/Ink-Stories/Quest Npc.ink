Thank god you are here! #speaker : Village chief 

I bestow upon you, our noble warrior, a solemn task: rid our island of the goblin scourge once and for all. Lead us to reclaim every corner of our beloved home.
To reclaim our island, you must venture forth and conquer the four dungeons scattered across its expanse. Each holds a key to our liberation, restoring peace to our cherished lands.    

May your courage guide you, and may each swing of your blade bring us closer to lasting peace.

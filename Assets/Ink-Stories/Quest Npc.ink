Ah, the brave knight! The tales of your courage precede you. Our land has been overrun by goblins who have taken refuge in the old mines scattered across Tiny Kingdom. 
There are four such dungeons, each hiding deep within our land.To reclaim our home, you must find and clear each of these goblin-infested mines. 
Only then will our village know peace again.Once you have vanquished the goblins from all four dungeons, return to us. Our future depends on your bravery.
Good luck, noble knight...

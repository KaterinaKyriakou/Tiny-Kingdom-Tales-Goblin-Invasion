Ah, brave knight, you have returned! You have cleared all four dungeons and banished the goblins from our land.
The villagers can now live without fear, and prosperity will return once more. 
On behalf of all the villagers, I extend our deepest gratitude. Your name will be remembered in our history as the savior of Tiny Kingdom.
Thank you, valiant knight!
